 * Make player re-acquire lock when targeting subsystems on a locked ship.
 * 
 * 11    3/10/98 4:19p John
 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to
 * support Fred.  Made zbuffering key off of functions rather than one
 * global variable.

 * 10    2/28/98 7:03p Lawrance
 * Change player missile locking to use dot product, so we can use it in
 * the external views
 * 
 * 9     1/23/98 6:25p Lawrance
 * Change player missile locking to lock on subsystem points automatically
 * 
 * 8     1/21/98 7:20p Lawrance
 * Make subsystem locking only work with line-of-sight, cleaned up locking
 * code, moved globals to player struct.

 * 7     1/19/98 10:02p Lawrance
 * Fix bug with locking on friendlies
 * 
 * 6     11/17/97 6:37p Lawrance
 * new gauges: extended target view, new lock triangles, support ship view
 * 
 * 5     4/13/97 3:53p Lawrance
 * separate out the non-rendering dependant portions of the HUD ( sounds,
 * updating lock position, changing targets, etc) and put into
 * hud_update_frame()
