 * FS2_DEMO initial checkin
 * 
 * 5     7/01/99 11:44a Dave
 * Updated object sound system to allow multiple obj sounds per ship.
 * Added hit-by-beam sound. Added killed by beam sound.
 *

 * 
 * 29    4/02/98 6:30p Lawrance
 * reduce max debris piece if DEMO defined
 * 
 * 28    4/02/98 11:40a Lawrance
 * check for #ifdef DEMO instead of #ifdef DEMO_RELEASE
 * 
 * 27    2/26/98 10:07p Hoffoss
 * Rewrote state saving and restoring to fix bugs and simplify the code.

 * Further work on asteroids.
 * 
 * 25    2/10/98 6:43p Lawrance
 * Moved asteroid code to a separate lib.
 * 
 * 24    2/06/98 3:08p Mike
 * More asteroid stuff, including resolving conflicts between the two
 * asteroid_field structs!

 * 23    2/05/98 12:51a Mike
 * Early asteroid stuff.
 * 
 * 22    1/29/98 5:50p John
 * Made electrical arcing on debris pieces be persistent from frame to
 * frame
 * 
 * 21    1/21/98 7:18p Lawrance
 * Fix bug with creating debris before the mission starts.
 * 
 * 20    12/22/97 9:56p Andsager

 * 
 * 18    10/01/97 10:52a Mike

 * fixed bug with species specific debris shards.
 * 
 * 16    8/13/97 9:50p Allender
