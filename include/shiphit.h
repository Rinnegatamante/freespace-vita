 *
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.2  2002/06/09 04:41:15  relnev
 * added copyright header
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:12  root
 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 9     8/22/99 5:53p Dave
 * Scoring fixes. Added self destruct key. Put callsigns in the logfile
 * instead of ship designations for multiplayer players.
 * 
 * 8     6/21/99 7:25p Dave
 * netplayer pain packet. Added type E unmoving beams.
 * 
 * 7     5/11/99 10:16p Andsager
 * First pass on engine wash effect.  Rotation (control input), damage,
 * shake.  
 * 
 * 6     4/20/99 3:43p Andsager
 * Added normal parameter to ship_apply_local_damage for case of ship_ship
 * collision.
 * 
 * 5     2/04/99 1:23p Andsager
 * Apply max spark limit to ships created in mission parse
 * 
 * 4     10/20/98 1:39p Andsager
 * Make so sparks follow animated ship submodels.  Modify
 * ship_weapon_do_hit_stuff() and ship_apply_local_damage() to add
 * submodel_num.  Add submodel_num to multiplayer hit packet.
 * 
 * 3     10/16/98 1:22p Andsager

 * 1     10/07/98 10:51a Dave
 * 
 * 8     5/18/98 12:41a Allender
 * fixed subsystem problems on clients (i.e. not reporting properly on
 * damage indicator).  Fixed ingame join problem with respawns.  minor
 * comm menu stuff
 * 
 * 7     4/24/98 5:35p Andsager
 * Fix sparks sometimes drawing not on model.  If ship is sphere in
 * collision, don't draw sparks.  Modify ship_apply_local_damage() to take
 * parameter no_spark.
 * 
 * 6     4/09/98 5:44p Allender
 * multiplayer network object fixes.  debris and self destructed ships
 * should all sync up.  Fix problem where debris pieces (hull pieces) were
 * not getting a net signature
 * 
 * 5     2/13/98 2:22p Allender
 * make ships spark when entering mission with < 100% hull
 * 
 * 4     10/16/97 4:41p Allender
 * new packet to tell clients when subsystem has been destroyed
 * 
 * 3     9/18/97 4:08p John
 * Cleaned up & restructured ship damage stuff.
 * 
 * 2     9/17/97 5:12p John
 * Restructured collision routines.  Probably broke a lot of stuff.
