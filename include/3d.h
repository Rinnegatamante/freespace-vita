rotate a point, the CC_OFF_USER bit will be set in the clipping codes.

rotation (or g3_code_vertex call) by a vector subtraction and dot
product.   It won't slow anything down for polys that are completely
clipped on or off by the plane, and will slow each clipped polygon by
not much more than any other clipping we do.
