 * added copyright header
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:11  root
 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 3     11/05/98 5:55p Dave
 * Big pass at reducing #includes
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:52a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:48a Dave
 * 
 * 20    4/11/98 5:17p Jim
 * Reduced countermeasure firing rate from 2 times per second to 3 times
 * per second.
 * 
 * 19    4/10/98 11:02p Mike
 * Make countermeasures less effective against aspect seekers than against
 * heat seekers.
 * Make AI ships match bank with each other when attacking a faraway
 * target.
 * Make ships not do silly loop-de-loop sometimes when attacking a faraway
 * target.
 * 
 * 18    4/01/98 5:34p John
 * Made only the used POFs page in for a level.   Reduced some interp
 * arrays.    Made custom detail level work differently.
 * 
 * 17    2/26/98 10:07p Hoffoss
 * Rewrote state saving and restoring to fix bugs and simplify the code.
 * 
 * 16    2/23/98 4:30p Mike
 * Make homing missiles detonate after they pass up their target.  Make
 * countermeasures less effective.
 * 
 * 15    2/09/98 8:04p Lawrance
 * Add objnum to cmeasure struct, correctly set source_objnum
 * 
 * 14    2/05/98 11:20p Lawrance
 * save/restore countermeasure data
 * 
 * 13    1/29/98 11:48a John
 * Added new counter measure rendering as model code.   Made weapons be
 * able to have impact explosion.
 * 
 * 12    1/16/98 11:43a Mike
 * Fix countermeasures.
 * 
 * 11    8/13/97 9:50p Allender
 * split *_move into *_process_pre and *_process_post functions.
 * process_pre functions called before object is moved.  _process_post
 * functions called after object is moved.  Reordered code in ship_post
 * and weapon_post for multiplayer
 * 
 * 10    8/13/97 4:45p Allender
 * fixed ship_fire_primary and fire_secondary to not take parameter for
 * determining whether to count ammo or not.  Fixed countermeasure firing
 * for multiplayer
 * 
 * 9     8/08/97 4:29p Allender
 * countermeasure stuff for multiplayer
 * 
 * 8     7/09/97 12:04a Mike
 * Error prevention in matrix_interpolate().
 * 
 * 7     6/24/97 10:04a Allender
 * major multiplayer improvements.  Better sequencing before game.
 * Dealing with weapon/fireball/counter measure objects between
 * client/host.  
 * 
 * 6     5/22/97 5:45p Mike
 * Better countermeasure firing, key off availability, specify in
 * weapons.tbl
 * 
 * 5     5/15/97 5:05p Mike
 * In the midst of changing subsystem targetnig from type-based to
 * pointer-based.
 * Also allowed you to view a target while dead.
 * 
 * 4     5/14/97 4:08p Lawrance
 * removing my_index from game arrays
 * 
 * 3     5/14/97 10:50a Mike
 * More countermeasure stuff.
 * 
 * 2     5/12/97 5:58p Mike
 * Add countermeasures.
 *
