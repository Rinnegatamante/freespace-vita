 * 4     6/29/99 10:35a Dave
 * Interface polygon bitmaps! Whee!
 * 
 * 3     12/06/98 2:36p Dave
 * Drastically improved nebula fogging.
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:49a Dave
 * 
 * 17    4/10/98 5:20p John
 * Changed RGB in lighting structure to be ubytes.  Removed old
 * not-necessary 24 bpp software stuff.
 * 
 * 16    4/09/98 7:58p John
 * Cleaned up tmapper code a bit.   Put NDEBUG around some ndebug stuff.
 * Took out XPARENT flag settings in all the alpha-blended texture stuff.
 * 
 * 15    4/09/98 4:38p John
 * Made non-darkening and transparent textures work under Glide.  Fixed
 * bug with Jim's computer not drawing any bitmaps.
 * 
 * 14    3/23/98 5:00p John
 * Improved missile trails.  Made smooth alpha under hardware.  Made end
 * taper.  Made trail touch weapon.
 * 
 * 13    11/21/97 11:32a John
 * Added nebulas.   Fixed some warpout bugs.
 * 
 * 12    10/15/97 5:08p John
 * added flag for alpha tmap
 * 
 * 11    3/10/97 5:20p John
 * Differentiated between Gouraud and Flat shading.  Since we only do flat
 * shading as of now, we don't need to interpolate L in the outer loop.
 * This should save a few percent.
 * 
 * 10    3/05/97 7:15p John
 * took out the old z stop tmapper used for briefing. 
 * 
 * 9     12/10/96 10:37a John
 * Restructured texture mapper to remove some overhead from each scanline
 * setup.  This gave about a 30% improvement drawing trans01.pof, which is
 * a really complex model.  In the process, I cleaned up the scanline
 * functions and separated them into different modules for each pixel
 * depth.   
 * 
 * 8     11/07/96 2:17p John
 * Took out the OldTmapper stuff.
 * 
 * 7     11/05/96 4:05p John
 * Added roller.  Added code to draw a distant planet.  Made bm_load
 * return -1 if invalid bitmap.
 * 
 * 6     10/26/96 1:40p John
 * Added some now primitives to the 2d library and
 * cleaned up some old ones.
