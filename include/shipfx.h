 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:12  root
 * Initial import.

 * 
 * 10    7/02/99 9:55p Dave
 * Player engine wash sound.
 * 
 * 9     5/24/99 5:45p Dave
 * Added detail levels to the nebula, with a decent speedup. Split nebula
 * lightning into its own section.
 * 
 * 8     5/18/99 1:30p Dave
 * Added muzzle flash table stuff.
 * 
 * 7     5/09/99 6:00p Dave
 * Lots of cool new effects. E3 build tweaks.
 * 
 * 6     3/23/99 2:29p Andsager
 * Fix shockwaves for kamikazi and Fred defined.  Collect together
 * shockwave_create_info struct.
 * 
 * 5     2/26/99 4:14p Dave
 * Put in the ability to have multiple shockwaves for ships.
 * 
 * 4     1/27/99 9:56a Dave
 * Temporary checkin of beam weapons for Dan to make cool sounds.
 * 
 * 3     10/20/98 1:39p Andsager
 * Make so sparks follow animated ship submodels.  Modify
 * ship_weapon_do_hit_stuff() and ship_apply_local_damage() to add
 * submodel_num.  Add submodel_num to multiplayer hit packet.
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:51a Dave
 * 
 * 19    5/22/98 5:32p Andsager
 * Make big ship explosion sounds play all the way through.  remove
 * cur_snd from ship struct.
 * 
 * 18    5/19/98 8:43p Andsager
 * Modify sound management (of big ship explosions).  Turn on big ship
 * explosions for release build.
 * 
 * 17    5/12/98 10:54p Andsager
 * Add new sound manager for big ship sub-explosion sounds
 * 
 * 16    4/14/98 11:11p John
 * Made ships with < 50% hull left show electrical damage arcs.
 * 
 * 15    4/14/98 5:43p John
 * Made large ship blowup system reinit between levels.
 * 
 * 14    4/14/98 4:56p John
 * Hooked in Andsager's large ship exploding code, but it is temporarily
 * disabled.
 * 
 * 13    4/10/98 12:16p Allender
 * fix ship hit kill and debris packets
 * 
 * 12    4/05/98 2:37p John
 * Made sun on by default.  Fixed some other sun tweaks.
 * 
 * 11    1/02/98 5:04p John
 * Several explosion related changes.  Made fireballs not be used as
 * ani's.  Made ship spark system expell particles.  Took away impact
 * explosion for weapon hitting ship... this needs to get added to weapon
 * info and makes shield hit more obvious.  Only make sparks when hit
 * hull, not shields.
 * 
 * 10    12/17/97 7:53p John
 * Fixed a bug where gunpoint for flashes were in world coordinates,
 * should have been object.
 * 
 * 9     12/17/97 5:11p John
 * Added brightening back into fade table.  Added code for doing the fast
 * dynamic gun flashes and thruster flashes.
 * 
 * 8     12/12/97 3:02p John
 * First Rev of Ship Shadows
 * 
 * 7     9/12/97 4:06p John
 * put in ship warp out effect.
 * put in dynamic lighting for warp in/out
 * 
 * 6     9/09/97 4:52p John
 * Almost done ship warp in code
 * 
 * 5     2/28/97 11:07a John
 * more fx
 * 
 * 4     2/28/97 10:57a John
 * Made so you can blow off any subsystems, not just radars.
 * 
 * 
 * 3     2/10/97 12:38p John
 * made all ships blow up into debris pieces when exploded.
 * 
 * 2     2/07/97 11:49a John
 * Some not-final explosions for turrets.
