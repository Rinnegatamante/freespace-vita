 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:12  root
 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 12    8/29/99 4:18p Andsager
 * New "burst" limit for friendly damage.  Also credit more damage done
 * against large friendly ships.
 * 
 * 11    8/26/99 5:14p Andsager
 * 
 * 10    7/26/99 12:14p Andsager
 * Apply cap to how much slower a transport flies with cargo.  Remove
 * limit on waypoint speed for training.  Enemy ai get stealth exact pos
 * when stealth fires
 * 
 * 9     7/02/99 10:56a Andsager
 * Put in big ship - big ship attack mode.  Modify stealth sweep ai.
 * 
 * 8     6/30/99 5:53p Dave
 * Put in new anti-camper code.
 * 
 * 7     6/23/99 5:51p Andsager
 * Add waypoint-cap-speed.  Checkin stealth ai - inactive.
 * 
 * 6     6/14/99 10:45a Dave
 * Made beam weapons specify accuracy by skill level in the weapons.tbl
 * 
 * 5     4/20/99 6:39p Dave
 * Almost done with artillery targeting. Added support for downloading
 * images on the PXO screen.
 * 
 * 4     4/20/99 3:40p Andsager
 * Changes to big ship ai.  Uses bounding box as limit where to fly to
 * when flying away.
 * 
 * 3     11/05/98 5:55p Dave
 * Big pass at reducing #includes
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave

 * 185   5/23/98 2:41p Mike
 * Make Easy the default skill level and prevent old pilot's skill level
 * from carrying into new pilot.
 * 
 * 184   5/20/98 12:45a Mike
 * Fix bug in support ships aborting rearm.  Also, remove test code that
 * made any ship whose name began, "Kami" a kamikaze.
 * 
 * 183   5/18/98 1:58a Mike
 * Make Phoenix not be fired at fighters (but yes bombers).
 * Improve positioning of ships in guard mode.
 * Make turrets on player ship not fire near end of support ship docking.
 * 
 * 182   5/13/98 4:41p Mike
 * Make big ships try a tiny bit to avoid collision with each other when
 * attacking another big ship.  Make ships a little less likely to collide
 * into player when in formation, drop off if player flying wacky.
 * 
 * 181   5/12/98 4:53p Mike
 * Make ships recover from collisions with big ships, eventually flying
 * around.
 * 
 * 180   5/10/98 11:30p Mike
 * Better firing of bombs, less likely to go into strafe mode.
 * 
 * 179   4/12/98 2:02p Mike
 * Make small ships avoid big ships.
 * Turn on Collide_friendly flag.
 * 
 * 178   4/10/98 11:02p Mike

 * heat seekers.
 * Make AI ships match bank with each other when attacking a faraway
 * target.
 * Make ships not do silly loop-de-loop sometimes when attacking a faraway
 * target.
 * 
 * 177   4/08/98 8:38a Mike
 * Make ships avoid player when attacking or guarding a faraway object.
 *

 * 
 * 174   3/21/98 3:36p Mike
 * Fix/optimize attacking of big ships.
 * 
 * 173   3/17/98 12:50a Mike
 * Improved kamikaze behavior.
 * 
 * 172   3/16/98 8:27p Allender
 * Fred support for two new AI flags -- kamikaze and no dynamic goals.
 * 
 * 171   3/16/98 12:03a Mike
 * Add support for kamikaze mode.  Add AIF_NO_DYNAMIC which means
 * relentlessly pursue current goal.
 * 
 * 170   3/15/98 9:44p Lawrance
 * Get secondary weapons for turrets working
 * 
 * 169   3/13/98 8:34a Mike
 * Intermediate checkin to resolve link errors.  Working on detecting
 * whether dock with player ship is obstructed by another ship
 * 
 * 168   3/09/98 5:12p Mike
 * Make sure Pl_objp uses are valid.
 * Throw asteroids at ships in asteroid field, not "Gal"
 * Support ships warp out if no goals after 30 seconds.
 * 
 * 167   2/26/98 10:07p Hoffoss
 * Rewrote state saving and restoring to fix bugs and simplify the code.
 * 
 * 166   2/22/98 4:17p John
 * More string externalization classification... 190 left to go!
 * 
 * 165   2/18/98 10:34p Allender
 * repair/rearm system (for single and multi) about finished.
 * dock/undock and ai goals packets implemented for multiplayer
 * 
 * 164   2/17/98 5:03p Allender
 * major cdhanges to rearm repair code.  All flag and variable setting
 * done in one function.  A little more work to do.  Fix bug in squad
 * messaging when hotkey was used on invalid target
 * 
 * 163   2/16/98 10:13p Allender
 * initial work on being able to target weapons (bombs specifically).
 * Work on getting rearm/repair working under multiplayer
