 * 7     3/12/98 5:36p John
 * Took out any unused shaders.  Made shader code take rgbc instead of
 * matrix and vector since noone used it like a matrix and it would have
 * been impossible to do in hardware.   Made Glide implement a basic
 * shader for online help.  
 * 
 * 6     3/10/98 4:19p John
 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to
 * support Fred.  Made zbuffering key off of functions rather than one
 * global variable.
 * 
 * 5     11/30/97 12:18p John
 * added more 24 & 32-bpp primitives
 * 
 * 4     11/18/96 1:48p Allender
 * added 16 bit version of (very slow) shader
 * 
 * 3     10/26/96 1:40p John
 * Added some now primitives to the 2d library and
 * cleaned up some old ones.
