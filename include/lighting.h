 * Added support for RGB lighting
 * 
 * 10    1/23/98 5:08p John
 * Took L out of vertex structure used B (blue) instead.   Took all small
 * fireballs out of fireball types and used particles instead.  Fixed some
 * debris explosion things.  Restructured fireball code.   Restructured
 * some lighting code.   Made dynamic lighting on by default. Made groups

// To calculate lighting, do:
// call light_filter_reset or light_filter.
// set up matrices with g3 functions
// call light_rotatate_all to rotate all valid
// lights into current coordinates.
// call light_apply to fill in lighting for a point.
