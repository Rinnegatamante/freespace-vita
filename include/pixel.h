 * 9     5/06/98 5:30p John
 * Removed unused cfilearchiver.  Removed/replaced some unused/little used
 * graphics functions, namely gradient_h and _v and pixel_sp.   Put in new
 * DirectX header files and libs that fixed the Direct3D alpha blending
 * problems.
 * 
 * 8     3/10/98 4:18p John
 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to
 * support Fred.  Made zbuffering key off of functions rather than one
 * global variable.
 * 
 * 7     5/29/97 3:10p John
 * Took out debug menu.  
 * Made software scaler draw larger bitmaps.
 * Optimized Direct3D some.
 * 
 * 6     5/12/97 12:27p John
 * Restructured Graphics Library to add support for multiple renderers.
 * 
 * 5     1/09/97 11:35a John
 * Added some 2d functions to get/put screen images.
 * 
 * 4     11/07/96 6:19p John
 * Added a bunch of 16bpp primitives so the game sort of runs in 16bpp
 * mode.
