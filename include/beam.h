 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.2  2002/06/09 04:41:12  relnev
 * added copyright header
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:12  root
 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 21    9/08/99 10:29p Dave
 * Make beam sound pausing and unpausing much safer.
 * 
 * 20    6/29/99 7:39p Dave
 * Lots of small bug fixes.
 * 
 * 19    6/21/99 7:25p Dave
 * netplayer pain packet. Added type E unmoving beams.
 * 
 * 18    6/18/99 5:16p Dave
 * Added real beam weapon lighting. Fixed beam weapon sounds. Added MOTD
 * dialog to PXO screen.
 * 
 * 17    6/04/99 2:16p Dave
 * Put in shrink effect for beam weapons.
 * 
 * 16    5/14/99 11:47a Andsager
 * Added  beam_get_weapon_info_index(object *bm)
 * 
 * 15    5/08/99 8:25p Dave
 * Upped object pairs. First run of nebula lightning.
 * 
 * 14    4/22/99 11:06p Dave
 * Final pass at beam weapons. Solidified a lot of stuff. All that remains
 * now is to tweak and fix bugs as they come up. No new beam weapon
 * features.
 * 
 * 13    4/21/99 6:15p Dave
 * Did some serious housecleaning in the beam code. Made it ready to go
 * for anti-fighter "pulse" weapons. Fixed collision pair creation. Added
 * a handy macro for recalculating collision pairs for a given object.
 * 
 * 12    4/20/99 6:39p Dave
 * Almost done with artillery targeting. Added support for downloading
 * images on the PXO screen.
 * 
 * 11    4/19/99 11:01p Dave
 * More sophisticated targeting laser support. Temporary checkin.
 * 
 * 10    4/16/99 5:54p Dave
 * Support for on/off style "stream" weapons. Real early support for
 * target-painting lasers.
 * 
 * 9     3/08/99 7:03p Dave
 * First run of new object update system. Looks very promising.
 * 
 * 8     3/04/99 6:09p Dave
 * Added in sexpressions for firing beams and checking for if a ship is
 * tagged.
 * 
 * 7     1/30/99 1:29a Dave
 * Fixed nebula thumbnail problem. Full support for 1024x768 choose pilot
 * screen.  Fixed beam weapon death messages.
 * 
 * 6     1/24/99 11:37p Dave
 * First full rev of beam weapons. Very customizable. Removed some bogus
 * Int3()'s in low level net code.
 * 
 * 5     1/21/99 10:45a Dave
 * More beam weapon stuff. Put in warmdown time.
 * 
 * 4     1/14/99 12:48a Dave
 * Todo list bug fixes. Made a pass at putting briefing icons back into
 * FRED. Sort of works :(
 * 
 * 3     1/12/99 12:53a Dave
 * More work on beam weapons - made collision detection very efficient -
 * collide against all object types properly - made 3 movement types
 * smooth. Put in test code to check for possible non-darkening pixels on
 * object textures.
 * 
 * 2     1/08/99 2:08p Dave
 * Fixed software rendering for pofview. Super early support for AWACS and
 * beam weapons.
 *
