 * 
 * 94    8/15/97 9:59a Hoffoss
 * Changed ai_query_goal_valid() again.  I can't think of any time you
 * wouldn't find it easier just to pass in a ship instead of a ship_info
 * flag structure filtered of all flags that aren't ship type bits.  Since
 * I'll call this quite a few times, it will make my life easier.
 * 
 * 93    8/15/97 9:49a Hoffoss

 * fixed problem with wings completing waypoint goals
 * 
 * 85    8/06/97 9:41a Allender
 * renamed from ai_goal function.  made a function to remove a goal from a
 * wing (used strictly for waypoints now).  ai-chase-wing and

 * function which deals with sexpression goals
 * 
 * 84    8/06/97 8:06a Lawrance

 * 
 * Suppress a couple annoying mprints and clarify another.
 * 
 * 80    7/25/97 12:10p Mike
 * Better default behavior.
 * 
 * 79    7/24/97 4:55p Allender
 * added ai-evade-ship to fred and to Freespace
 * 
 * 78    7/24/97 4:20p Mike
 * Add goal and Fred hook for evade behavior.
 * 
 * 77    7/24/97 2:17p Jasen
 * Fixed a bug with mission loading.
 * 
 * 76    7/24/97 12:10a Mike
 * Suppress problems when loadign pain.fsm.
 * 
 * 75    7/23/97 6:49p Hoffoss
 * Fixed bug in ai goal adding code.  It was using a pointer that was
 * temporary.
 * 
 * 74    7/23/97 11:25a Allender
 * more robust sexpression checking.  Fixed problem with some ai goals not
 * being named properly
