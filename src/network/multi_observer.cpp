 * 
 * 6     9/14/99 2:21p Dave
 * Fixed observer mode joining and ingame stuff.
 * 
 * 5     8/19/99 10:59a Dave
 * Packet loss detection.
 * 
 * 4     11/17/98 11:12a Dave
 * Removed player identification by address. Now assign explicit id #'s.
 * 
 * 3     11/05/98 5:55p Dave
 * Big pass at reducing #includes
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave

 * 1     10/07/98 10:50a Dave
 * 
 * 13    6/13/98 6:01p Hoffoss
 * Externalized all new (or forgot to be added) strings to all the code.
 * 
 * 12    6/04/98 11:04a Allender
 * object update level stuff.  Don't reset to high when becoming an
 * observer of any type.  default to low when guy is a dialup customer
 * 
 * 11    5/22/98 9:49p Allender
 * make observers Player_ship hidden from sensors so that he cannot target
 * his "ship".
 * 
 * 10    5/19/98 11:36p Allender
 * fixed very nasty mask problem with ingame joiner marking player objects
 * incorrectly.  Named ingame joiner ship and observer ship unique names
 * 
 * 9     4/18/98 5:00p Dave
 * Put in observer zoom key. Made mission sync screen more informative.
 * 
 * 8     4/03/98 3:13p Dave
 * More work on udp reliable transport. Fixed observer hud offset problem.
 * Made observer join and ingame join work again. Put subnet broadcasting
 * in for TCP.
 * 
 * 7     3/30/98 6:27p Dave
 * Put in a more official set of multiplayer options, including a system
 * for distributing netplayer and netgame settings.
 * 
 * 6     3/24/98 5:00p Dave
 * Fixed several ui bugs. Put in pre and post voice stream playback sound
 * fx. Put in error specific popups for clients getting dropped from games
 * through actions other than their own.
 * 
 * 5     3/23/98 5:42p Dave
 * Put in automatic xfer of pilot pic files. Changed multi_xfer system so
 * that it can support multiplayer sends/received between client and
 * server simultaneously.
 * 
 * 4     3/15/98 4:17p Dave
 * Fixed oberver hud problems. Put in handy netplayer macros. Reduced size
 * of network orientation matrices.
 * 
 * 3     3/14/98 2:48p Dave
 * Cleaned up observer joining code. Put in support for file xfers to
 * ingame joiners (observers or not). Revamped and reinstalled pseudo
 * lag/loss system.
 * 
 * 2     3/13/98 2:51p Dave
 * Put in support for observers to join ingame.
