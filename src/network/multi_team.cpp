 * 
 * 13    9/08/99 1:59p Dave
 * Nailed the problem with assigning teams improperly in TvT. Basic

 * info that the server was willingly accepting, thereby blowing away his
 * own info.
 * 
 * 12    8/22/99 1:55p Dave
 * Cleaned up host/team-captain leaving code.
 * 
 * 11    8/22/99 1:19p Dave
 * Fixed up http proxy code. Cleaned up scoring code. Reverse the order in
 * which d3d cards are detected.
 * 
 * 10    4/09/99 2:21p Dave
 * Multiplayer beta stuff. CD checking.
 * 
 * 9     3/10/99 6:50p Dave
 * Changed the way we buffer packets for all clients. Optimized turret

 * 7     2/17/99 2:11p Dave
 * First full run of squad war. All freespace and tracker side stuff
 * works.
 * 
 * 6     2/11/99 3:08p Dave
 * PXO refresh button. Very preliminary squad war support.
 * 
 * 5     11/19/98 8:03a Dave
 * Full support for D3-style reliable sockets. Revamped packet lag/loss
 * system, made it receiver side and at the lowest possible level.
 * 
 * 4     11/17/98 11:12a Dave
 * Removed player identification by address. Now assign explicit id #'s.
 * 
 * 3     11/05/98 5:55p Dave
 * Big pass at reducing #includes
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:50a Dave
 * 
 * 18    6/13/98 3:19p Hoffoss
 * NOX()ed out a bunch of strings that shouldn't be translated.
 * 
 * 17    5/26/98 7:33p Dave
 * Once extra check for TvT oktocommit. Tested against all cases.
 * 
 * 16    5/22/98 9:35p Dave

 * status for team vs. team. Put in asserts to check for invalid team vs.
 * team situations.
 * 
 * 14    5/03/98 7:04p Dave
 * Make team vs. team work mores smoothly with standalone. Change how host
 * interacts with standalone for picking missions. Put in a time limit for
 * ingame join ship select. Fix ingame join ship select screen for Vasudan
 * ship icons.
 * 
 * 13    4/22/98 5:53p Dave
 * Large reworking of endgame sequencing. Updated multi host options
 * screen for new artwork. Put in checks for host or team captains leaving
 * midgame.
 * 
 * 12    4/15/98 5:03p Dave
 * Put in a rough countdown to mission start on final sync screen. Fixed
 * several team vs. team bugs on the ship/team select screen.
 * 
 * 11    4/14/98 12:57a Dave

 * beginning of a game and follow it around as an observer full-time.
 *
