 * Initial checkin.

 * 9     3/10/98 4:18p John
 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to
 * support Fred.  Made zbuffering key off of functions rather than one
 * global variable.
 * 
 * 8     11/06/97 11:18a John
 * fixed bug with some scanlines being drawn twice
 * 
 * 7     11/26/96 6:50p John
 * Added some more hicolor primitives.  Made windowed mode run as current
 * bpp, if bpp is 8,16,or 32.
 * 
 * 6     11/26/96 4:30p John
 * Put in some better quality circle_empty code.
 * 
 * 5     11/07/96 6:19p John
 * Added a bunch of 16bpp primitives so the game sort of runs in 16bpp
 * mode.
 * 
 * 4     10/26/96 1:40p John
 * Added some now primitives to the 2d library and
 * cleaned up some old ones.
