 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:09  root
 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 3     12/02/98 5:47p Dave
 * Put in interface xstr code. Converted barracks screen to new format.
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:49a Dave
 * 
 * 14    5/06/98 5:30p John
 * Removed unused cfilearchiver.  Removed/replaced some unused/little used
 * graphics functions, namely gradient_h and _v and pixel_sp.   Put in new
 * DirectX header files and libs that fixed the Direct3D alpha blending
 * problems.
 * 
 * 13    3/10/98 4:18p John
 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to
 * support Fred.  Made zbuffering key off of functions rather than one
 * global variable.
 * 
 * 12    1/13/98 10:20a John
 * Added code to support "glass" in alphacolors
 * 
 * 11    10/19/97 12:55p John
 * new code to lock / unlock surfaces for smooth directx integration.
 * 
 * 10    10/14/97 8:08a John
 * added a bunch more 16 bit support
 * 
 * 9     10/09/97 5:23p John
 * Added support for more 16-bpp functions
 * 
 * 8     6/06/97 2:40p John
 * Made all the radar dim in/out
 * 
 * 7     5/29/97 3:09p John
 * Took out debug menu.  
 * Made software scaler draw larger bitmaps.
 * Optimized Direct3D some.
 * 
 * 6     5/12/97 12:27p John
 * Restructured Graphics Library to add support for multiple renderers.
 * 
 * 5     1/09/97 11:35a John
 * Added some 2d functions to get/put screen images.
 * 
 * 4     11/07/96 6:19p John
 * Added a bunch of 16bpp primitives so the game sort of runs in 16bpp
 * mode.
 * 
 * 3     10/26/96 1:40p John
 * Added some now primitives to the 2d library and
 * cleaned up some old ones.
