 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 5     9/05/99 11:25p Mikek
 * Debug code (only on NDEBUG).  Don't drop countermeasures if
 * Ai_firing_enabled not set.

 * 4     11/05/98 5:55p Dave
 * Big pass at reducing #includes
 * 
 * 3     10/13/98 9:28a Dave
 * Started neatening up freespace.h. Many variables renamed and
 * reorganized. Added AlphaColors.[h,cpp]
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:52a Dave

 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:48a Dave
 * 
 * 44    4/29/98 9:36p Allender

 * target.
 * Make ships not do silly loop-de-loop sometimes when attacking a faraway
 * target.
 * 
 * 40    3/31/98 5:11p John
 * Removed demo/save/restore.  Made NDEBUG defined compile.  Removed a
 * bunch of debug stuff out of player file.  Made model code be able to
 * unload models and malloc out only however many models are needed.

 * Put in code to show dummy counter measure object.
 * 
 * 29    1/23/98 5:06p John
 * Took L out of vertex structure used B (blue) instead.   Took all small
 * fireballs out of fireball types and used particles instead.  Fixed some
 * debris explosion things.  Restructured fireball code.   Restructured
 * some lighting code.   Made dynamic lighting on by default. Made groups
