 * fixed a potential exit-loop bug
 * 
 * 20    9/07/99 6:55p Jefff
 * functionality to break out of a loop.  hacked functionality to jump to

 * CD checking by act. Added support to play 2 cutscenes in a row
 * seamlessly. Fixed super low level cfile bug related to files in the
 * root directory of a CD. Added cheat code to set campaign mission # in
 * main hall.
 * 
 * 15    8/27/99 12:04a Dave
 * Campaign loop screen.
 * 
 * 14    8/04/99 5:36p Andsager

 * 
 * 9     12/09/98 1:56p Andsager
 * Initial checkin of mission loop
 * 
 * 8     11/05/98 5:55p Dave

 * 
 * 7     11/03/98 4:48p Johnson
 * Fixed campaign file versioning bug left over from Silent Threat port.
 * 
 * 6     10/23/98 3:51p Dave

 * Remove reference to Tech_shivan_species_avail
 * 
 * 4     10/13/98 9:28a Dave
 * Started neatening up freespace.h. Many variables renamed and
 * reorganized. Added AlphaColors.[h,cpp]
 * 
 * 3     10/07/98 6:27p Dave
 * Globalized mission and campaign file extensions. Removed Silent Threat
 * special code. Moved \cache \players and \multidata into the \data

 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:49a Dave

 * freespace and non mission disk freespace, including pilot files and
 * campaign savefiles.
 * 
 * 93    7/06/98 4:10p Hoffoss
 * Fixed some bugs that presented themselves when trying to use a pilot
 * that has a no longer existent campaign active.  Also expanded the

 * 
 * 87    5/12/98 4:16p Hoffoss
 * Fixed bug where not all missions in all campaigns were being filtered
 * out of stand alone mission listing in simulator room.
 * 
 * 86    5/05/98 3:29p Hoffoss
 * Changed code so description is BEFORE num players in campaign file.
 * Other code is relying on this ordering.
 * 
 * 85    5/05/98 12:19p Dave
 * campaign description goes *after* num players
 * 
 * 84    5/04/98 5:52p Comet
 * Fixed bug with Galatea/Bastion selection when finishing missions.
 * 
 * 83    5/01/98 2:46p Duncan
 * fix a cfile problem with campaigns related to the new cfile stuff
 * 
 * 82    5/01/98 12:34p John
 * Added code to force FreeSpace to run in the same dir as exe and made
 * all the parse error messages a little nicer.
 * 
 * 81    4/30/98 7:01p Duncan
 * AL: don't allow deletion of campaign files in multiplayer
 * 
 * 80    4/30/98 4:53p John
