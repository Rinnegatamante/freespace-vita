 * The Great Newline Fix
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/05/03 03:28:09  root
 * Initial import.
 *
 * 
 * 4     7/09/99 5:54p Dave
 * Seperated cruiser types into individual types. Added tons of new
 * briefing icons. Campaign screen.
 * 
 * 3     3/01/99 10:00a Dave
 * Fxied several dogfight related stats bugs.
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 6:28p Dave
 * Initial checkin. Renamed all relevant stuff to be Fred2 instead of
 * Fred. Globalized mission and campaign file extensions. Removed Silent
 * Threat specific code.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 3:02p Dave
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 3:00p Dave
 * 
 * 59    2/26/98 4:59p Allender
 * groundwork for team vs team briefings.  Moved weaponry pool into the
 * Team_data structure.  Added team field into the p_info structure.
 * Allow for mutliple structures in the briefing code.
 * 
 * 58    1/06/98 2:27p Hoffoss
 * Made wing deleting free up arrival and departure cue sexp trees, which
 * wasn't happening before for some reason.
 * 
 * 57    12/29/97 4:55p Johnson
 * Added some fixes.
 * 
 * 56    11/21/97 11:46a Johnson
 * Changed code to delete reinforcement wings when the wing is deleted.
 * 
 * 55    11/13/97 4:14p Allender
 * automatic assignment of hotkeys for starting wings.  Appripriate
 * warnings when they are incorrectly used.  hotkeys correctly assigned to
 * ships/wing arriving after mission start
 * 
 * 54    10/01/97 12:37p Hoffoss
 * Changed Fred (and FreeSpace) to utilize alpha, beta and gamma as player
 * starting wing names.
 * 
 * 53    9/16/97 9:41p Hoffoss
 * Changed Fred code around to stop using Parse_player structure for
 * player information, and use actual ships instead.
 * 
 * 52    9/11/97 4:04p Hoffoss
 * Fixed bug in Fred: disband wing wasn't making sure the ship editor's
 * data was synced.
 * 
 * 51    9/06/97 2:13p Mike
 * Replace support for TEAM_NEUTRAL
 * 
 * 50    9/02/97 3:44p Johnson
 * Fixed bugs with thresholds not being lowered.
 * 
 * 49    9/02/97 3:24p Johnson
 * Fixed bug: ships removed from wings will lower threshold if required.
 * 
 * 48    8/30/97 9:52p Hoffoss
 * Implemented arrival location, distance, and anchor in Fred.
 * 
 * 47    8/25/97 5:58p Hoffoss
 * Created menu items for keypress functions in Fred, and fixed bug this
 * uncovered with wing_delete function.
 * 
 * 46    8/16/97 6:44p Hoffoss
 * Changes to allow any player to be in a wing.
 * 
 * 45    8/16/97 4:51p Hoffoss
 * Fixed bugs with wing deletion and removing ships from a wing.
 * 
 * 44    8/15/97 1:07a Hoffoss
 * Changed code to disallow some ship types from being in a wing, and
 * disallowing some ship types from being able to have initial orders.
 * 
 * 43    8/12/97 1:55a Hoffoss
 * Made extensive changes to object reference checking and handling for
 * object deletion call.
 * 
 * 42    8/10/97 4:24p Hoffoss
 * Added warning when creating a wing if wing is mixed.
 * 
 * 41    8/08/97 1:31p Hoffoss
 * Added syncronization protection to cur_object_index changes.
 * 
 * 40    8/08/97 10:07a Hoffoss
 * Fixed bug where ship references aren't updated when wing is created
 * (i.e. ships being renamed, but not in the references too).
 * 
 * 39    8/01/97 3:24p Hoffoss
 * Fixed bug where when player is removed from a wing, the ship associated
 * with the player doesn't get it's wingnum variable updated.

 * 38    7/09/97 2:38p Allender
 * organized ship/wing editor dialogs.  Added protect ship and ignore
 * count checkboxes to those dialogs.  Changed flag code for
 * parse_objects.  Added unprotect sexpressions
 * 
 * 37    6/30/97 11:36a Hoffoss
 * Fixed bug with wing reforming.
 * 
 * 36    6/18/97 2:36p Hoffoss
 * Wing ship numbering starts at 1 instead of 0, and changed form wing to
 * allow reforming a wing.
 * 
 * 35    6/04/97 12:00a Allender
 * make wing goal priorities default to -1 so that their priorities get
 * set more appropriatly in the initial order dialog

 * Fixed bug.
 * 
 * 30    3/20/97 3:55p Hoffoss

 * problems.
 * 
 * 29    3/17/97 4:29p Hoffoss
 * Automated player's wing flaging as a starting player wing.
 * 
 * 28    3/12/97 12:40p Hoffoss

 * Changed wing create code to bash ship's cues to false.
 * 
 * 23    2/24/97 5:38p Hoffoss

 * to match wing name, and code to maintain these ship names.
 * 
 * 22    2/20/97 4:03p Hoffoss
 * Several ToDo items: new reinforcement clears arrival cue, reinforcement
 * control from ship and wing dialogs, show grid toggle.
